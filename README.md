# MPADA
The implementation of $MP_{ada}$ in Attention-based Multi-patch Aggregation for Image Aesthetic Assessment [[pdf](http://chongyangma.com/publications/am/2018_am_paper.pdf)], the method for SOTA aesthetic visual assessment performance on AVA benchmark. For more comparisons on AVA, please refer to the [[page](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/aesthetics-quality-assessment-on-ava)] on PaperWithCode.

## Framework
![SystemOverview](https://github.com/Openning07/MPADA/blob/master/FromPaper/SystemOverview.png "MPADA")

System overview. We use an attention-based objective to enhance training signals by assigning relatively
larger weights to misclassified image patches.

## Experiments
### Requirements
* python == 3.6
* tensorflow == 1.2.1
* tensorpack == 0.6
#### Notes
 - Tensorpack does not implement AVA2012. You need to put the **ava2012.py** in *AVA_info* in the folder of tensorpack.dataflow.dataset.
 - For the information of training and test split of AVA benchmark, please refer to **AVA_train.lst** and **AVA_test.lst** in *AVA_info*.

### Instructions for Results in the paper
    python AVA2012-resnet_20180808_Revised.py --gpu 2 --data $YOUR_DATA_DIR$/AVA2012 --aesthetic_level 2 --crop_method_TS RandomCrop --repeat_times 15 --load $YOUR_CHECKPOINT_DIR$/checkpoint --mode resnet -d 18 --eval 
### Desired Outputs
#### Notes
 - $YOUR_DATA_DIR$ : The directory you put *images* of the AVA benchmark.
 - $YOUR_CHECKPOINT_DIR$ : The directory you save the *checkpoint* files of the models.
 - Result might not be reproduced due to several factors: different version of cv2, different CUDA version, different split of training/test.
